                        <p>Thank you for taking time to participate in our study.  The purpose of the study was to learn more about driversâ€™ perceived usability and satisfaction with the dashboard design. Your responses will be evaluated along with the website analytics and data about your individual characteristics (years of experience driving, etc.) to help researchers learn more about how individual differences among drivers impacted interface usability and driver satisfaction.  The data that you provided will never be released or reported; it will only be analyzed as part of the entire group of data.</p>
                          <p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated by our design team for use in improving our interface.  If you have any further questions, concerns or comments for the researchers, please contact Holly at hollyrae@iastate.edu.</p>
